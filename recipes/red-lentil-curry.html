            <li>1 tbsp coconut oil</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 inch piece of fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 tbsp minced fresh turmeric</li>
            <li>1-2 serrano peppers, diced</li>
            <li>1 cup red lentils</li>
            <li>2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the lentils in cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>Heat a large, deep skillet or large saucepan over medium-high heat and add the coconut oil. Once the oil is shimmering, add the garlic, ginger, fresh turmeric (if using), and Serrano pepper and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent garlic from burning.</li>
            <li>Add the cumin, coriander, chili powder, curry powder, garam masala, salt, and black pepper to taste, and cook for 30 to 60 seconds until fragrant, tossing frequently to prevent burning. If using ground turmeric instead of fresh turmeric, add the ground turmeric now, along the the rest of the spices.</li>
